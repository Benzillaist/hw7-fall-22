# Collaborating

We recognize that this may be the first time that you have had to work in a team in your CS classes, so we want to give you the proper tools to succeed:

> Why do we have to work in a team?

- In other CS classes, such as 320 or 326 you will have to work closely with a team. Also, once you graduate and get a job there will be many instances where you will be asked to collaborate with others. We want students to be prepared to work with others and make sure you all have the tools to succeed later in your career.
- The project can have a bigger scope and can be more complex when students are able to closely collaborate.

> Why can't we choose our own groups?

- Groups are random to give students a chance to work with people they typically wouldn't. We hope that this will be a way for students to get to know each other and step out of their comfort zones.
- We will not accommodate students switching groups to work with their friends, so don't ask.

> How should we communicate and meet to work

- This is up to you as a team, but we have a few tips.
- Reach out to your team early, everyone has busy schedules and communicating early is the best way to have time to collaborate.
- You are welcome to create your own group chat on some external platform (iMessage, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.), or you can create a group DM on CampusWire. Use the initial email thread to organize this.

- Meet physically on campus or virtually on zoom or discord to actually discuss and work on the project. You can reserve a study space in the library here: <https://libcal.library.umass.edu/reserve/groupstudyrooms>

> How should we collaborate

- Even though this is a group assignment, we expect that every student understands all the concepts covered by this homework and understands the entire code that is submitted by the group.
- All team members should contribute equally. It is natural that some team members will be more experienced with some topics of the class. It is your responsibility to ensure that everyone understands the material.
- You should not assign different parts of the assignment to separate people. All team members should work on all parts of the assignment. A good way to do this is to program together as a group where all members discuss the solution while one person writes the actual code.

> What tools can we use to facilitate collaboration?

- You could use git with online services like Github, GitLab, or BitBucket if your group is interested
- **There is also the VSCode LiveShare extension which might be a bit easier. Here are a few links on how to that get started**:

> What if there are problems in our group?

- If you feel that there some team members are not contributing equally, or feel that there are any other problems, please make a private post on CampusWire.
- It is expected that all students will abide by the Equity and Inclusion Statement and Academic Honesty policies posted on Moodle when interacting with other students.

P.S.: Since this is the first time we are doing a group project in 220 please let us know how this project could be improved in the future, your feedback will directly impact the course for future students.
